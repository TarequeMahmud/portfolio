        I am a Full Stack Developer with a passion for turning ideas into
        scalable, secure, and user-friendly web applications. I specialize in
        crafting full solutions — from designing sleek interfaces in Figma and
        building interactive frontends with React and Next.js, to developing
        robust backends using Node.js, Express, and various SQL and NoSQL
        databases. My expertise covers authentication, real-time communication,
        API development, and web security, ensuring reliable and high-performing
        applications. I am comfortable managing data through ER diagrams and
        modern ORMs/ODMs like Prisma and Mongoose. With a background in
        Electrical and Electronics Engineering, I approach problems with
        analytical thinking and a fast-learning mindset, adapting quickly to new
        technologies and challenges.
